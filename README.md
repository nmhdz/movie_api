## Project Description 
The objective of this project was to build the server-side component of a “movies” web application that provides users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Additionally, users are able to sign up, update their
personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
## User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I
can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
* As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies
